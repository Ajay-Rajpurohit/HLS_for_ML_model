This project uses high-level synthesis to implement a CNN for brain tumor detection on FPGAs.
The 14-layer model was optimized for hardware compatibility and performance,
employing techniques like loop unrolling and pipelining,
leading to reduced latency and efficient resource use on the FPGA.

for understanding the complete process u can go through the report attached with the project files.
